#+HTML: <img src="./assets/logo.webp" width="256px" align="right" alt="A cyberpunk-themed scene with a sleeker, less muscular hacker bunny wearing dark glasses, a stylish futuristic hoodie, and a visible black tank top beneath. The bunny, now with a slimmer, more toned build, exhibits a concentrated look as it types on an old-fashioned computer terminal. A half-eaten orange carrot is next to the keyboard. The scene is vibrantly lit with neon lights, enhancing the cyberpunk ambiance. A speech bubble above the bunny reads 'What's up Doc?' in a bold, cyber font, and the screen displays 'ELAIZA' in green monospaced font."/>
